# Read me?

This just few template for ImGui that i created? 

### in case you saw wierd style of mine im sorry that maybe i dont follow code standard 🙏
m_ = member valiable <br>
k_ = constexpr (usually im using constexpr rathe const) <br>
b_ = boolean <br>

for Parameter function, im using za snakecase <br> <br>
also im using pch.h to include everything that neccessary, precompile, you know maybe usefull and make it faster somehow <br>
for my purpose i changed every int with <br>
<br>
std::int64_t <br>
std::int32_t <br>
std::int16_t <br>
<br>
i might mix some ASM for fun
